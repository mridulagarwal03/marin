# External runtime dependencies

This directory tracks Python tools and artifacts that Marin installs into
isolated runtime environments.

The Evalchemy, Harbor, and MarinSkyRL uv projects are excluded from the root
workspace so their dependency graphs do not have to resolve with Marin's
training and serving dependencies. Each `pyproject.toml` follows the external
repository by branch or immutable revision, and its adjacent `uv.lock` records
the exact commit Marin uses.

Verified evaluation cohorts select revisions from `RUNTIME_COMMITS` in
`lib/marin/src/marin/evaluation/eval_policy.py`. The `harbor/pins/<Harbor commit>/`
snapshots retain their full dependency locks. Preflight and workers run the
selected lock with `uv run --frozen`; the external dependency updater advances
only the top-level projects.

`vllm/gpu.toml` records the promoted CUDA release, Torch backend, and
architecture-specific wheel URLs and SHA-256 digests. It is updated from the
release manifest only after the H100 and GB200 publication gates pass. It is
not a uv project and the nightly update does not advance it.

`vllm/tpu.toml` records an exact vLLM source from the fork's maintained `main`
lineage and the matching `tpu-inference` SHA. The TPU stack runs from an
isolated uvx env rather than the workspace. It is not a uv project either;
refresh it through
`.agents/skills/refresh-fork/SKILL.md`.

The packaged pin table at
`lib/marin/src/marin/external_dependencies.py` is generated from the locks, the
vLLM GPU release config, and the TPU serving fork descriptor. Runtime code imports
that module instead of reading repository-relative configuration.

Advance one project with:

```bash
uv run config/update-external.py evalchemy
```

Omit the project name to advance all three Git projects. The command updates
the selected lockfiles and regenerates the packaged requirements. Regenerate
only the promoted vLLM release after editing `vllm/gpu.toml` with:

```bash
uv run config/update-external.py vllm
```

The generated module also carries the isolated TPU-vLLM requirements from
`vllm/tpu.toml`; those forks are not part of the nightly upgrade set.
Verify that all generated state is current without contacting the repositories:

```bash
uv run config/update-external.py --check
```

`Ops - External Dependency Update` runs the all-project command every six hours
and can also be started with `workflow_dispatch`. It opens or refreshes one
`automation/external-dependencies` pull request containing every changed lock
and generated pin. The dedicated updater app merges after the required checks
pass. A failed check or one-hour timeout leaves the pull request open and fails
the scheduled run. The workflow log and pull request body list each resolved
package version and commit, followed by the upstream commit subjects in every
changed range. Generate the same Markdown summary locally with `--summary-file
<path>`; commit metadata is read through the authenticated GitHub CLI.

The six-hour schedule is the update-discovery interval. Under normal GitHub
Actions scheduling, a green update lands in the same run; a blocked update is
visible within the workflow's 90-minute deadline. Launches continue to consume
only commits already landed on Marin's default branch.

The external configurations intentionally model only what Marin needs:

- `evalchemy` resolves the endpoint client core. Benchmark extras are selected
  by each evaluation at runtime.
- `harbor` resolves the Git checkout and pinned Daytona SDK used only by the
  isolated evaluation driver. The `harbor_config` modules are installed from
  that same checkout rather than a second package source, so runtime and error
  taxonomy advance atomically. Harbor is absent from Marin's workspace lock.
- `MarinSkyRL` tracks the repository-root `marinskyrl` distribution. The
  external lock resolves its CPU-safe base for the isolated launcher. The
  launcher synchronizes the selected `fsdp` or `megatron` profile from that
  revision's frozen root lock inside the cluster's standard Iris task image.
- `vllm` records the promoted GPU wheels (`gpu.toml`) and a main-line source
  paired with tpu-inference for TPU (`tpu.toml`). The GPU and TPU wheels have
  independent build and promotion paths. Neither is a workspace dependency.

Evaluation provenance stores the generated commit-pinned runtime requirement.
For Evalchemy it identifies the exact Evalchemy checkout; for Harbor the one
Harbor commit identifies both the runtime and its `harbor_config` modules.

`migration.toml` describes how to migrate each fork toward upstream — the base to
select, the Marin e2e that validates it, and the constraints to respect. It holds
no pins; the `refresh-fork` skill reads a section to refresh one fork. The weekly
`ops-fork-ferry` workflow runs that skill for each supported pin or group.

To add another external tool, create an isolated project and register its
directory, distribution, and generated constant in `config/update-external.py`,
then add a `migration.toml` section for it. Consumers should use the generated
`ExternalDependency.requirement()` rather than reading a lockfile or copying its
commit.
