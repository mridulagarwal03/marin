# Testing Guidelines

This is Marin's project-wide testing policy. Module-specific `AGENTS.md` and
`TESTING.md` files are authoritative for local commands, markers, fakes, mocks,
numerical tolerances, and integration-test boundaries. Before writing or
reviewing tests, read root `AGENTS.md`, this file, the nearest module
`AGENTS.md`, and any testing docs referenced there.

## Running Tests Locally

Run a narrow test while editing, then run all safe tests affected by the branch
and working tree:

```bash
uv run pytest <test path>
uv run --no-project infra/ci/run_tests.py
```

The repository defaults exclude `slow`, `integration`, `data_integration`,
`cluster`, `requires_cluster`, `docker`, and `manual` tests. Do not pass a
partial marker expression such as `-m "not slow"`; pytest replaces the default
expression and may select live-cluster tests. Run excluded markers only when
requested or directed by the relevant module guide.

Tests run from the repository root have a 60-second per-test timeout, including
fixture setup and teardown. On POSIX, pytest-timeout first interrupts the test
with `SIGALRM`; if the test suppresses that failure, the test process exits five
seconds later. Give a legitimately longer test an explicit
`@pytest.mark.timeout(...)` value instead of increasing the repository default.

A formatter-only mechanical edit does not require another test run. Rerun the
repository formatting and lint checks after the edit; rerun tests only when the
follow-up changes executable behavior or test expectations.

## Adding a New Library

When adding a new `lib/<name>/` package, run its unit tests through
[unified-unit.yaml](.github/workflows/unified-unit.yaml). Add its short name to
`SCOPES` and its uv package name to `UV_PACKAGE` in
[select_tests.py](infra/ci/select_tests.py). The selector uses
`lib/<name>/tests` by default; update `TEST_DIRS` if its tests live elsewhere.
These registrations include the library in pull request, push, and full-suite
runs.

Root `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` changes run the broad CPU matrix. The
Levanter TPU lane runs for those changes when the resolved dependencies of
`marin-levanter` with its `tpu` extra and `test` group change, including
transitive dependencies. If the selector cannot compare the base and head
lockfiles, it runs the TPU lane. Levanter or Haliax source changes also select
the lane. The Levanter Torch lane retains its root manifest trigger. Scheduled
or manual runs without a base ref run every suite.

## Core Rule

A test must fail when behavior is wrong. It should not fail only because an
implementation detail, wording choice, helper call, or command assembly changed.

Do not add a test for every validation branch. A scalar or configuration guard
such as `count > 0`, enum membership, a required field, or a simple range check
does not justify a checked-in test by itself. Test such a guard only when it
reproduces a reported regression or protects a compatibility-critical public
contract. Otherwise, test the consequential behavior on the valid path or omit
the test.

Prefer integration-style tests that validate externally observable behavior:

- public API return values
- structured output or machine-readable fields
- persisted state
- real side effects in a temp directory or in-memory fake
- state transitions visible through the public event/status API
- numerical value and gradient parity against an independent reference

It is better to not have a test than to have "slop" tests (tautological or other useless tests). See below.

## Good Targets

- A regression for a reported bug.
- A boundary case where user-visible behavior changes: empty input, duplicate
  names, incompatible shapes, quota or capacity limits, timeout behavior, failed
  workers, bad files, or invalid configs.
- A round trip through the public API: submit a job, observe status, write
  chunks, read chunks, serialize, deserialize, reload.
- A stable contract: wire format, schema field, CLI JSON output, checkpoint
  layout, or public exception type.
- For numerical code, parity against an obvious reference implementation across
  a small shape/dtype grid.

## Slop Tests To Reject

Delete or rewrite tests with negative value:

- Tautologies: constant equals itself, method exists, object constructor assigns
  attributes, `len(list) >= 0`, type exists. This definition should be construed broadly.
- Private state: assertions on private attributes or `_`-prefixed state.
- Incidental strings: assertions on human log text, progress messages, command
  fragments, or copied prose.
- Internal helper dispatch: assertions on `assert_called_once_with`, call count,
  or "helper X was invoked" for in-process helpers.
- Reimplementation: Tests that reimplement the production logic and compare the implementation to
  itself.
- Obvious error-condition behavior: Obvious error-condition tests that only prove a type checker, dataclass
  constructor, or standard library function works. Infrastructure failure modes
  are valid when the failure is externally observable.
- Scalar and configuration guards: standalone tests that only set a count,
  timeout, enum, boolean, or other config value outside an obvious allowed range
  and assert that construction raises. Keep one only for a reported regression
  or a compatibility-critical public contract.
- Tests for Python language semantics.
- Registration tests: Tests that check that specific items are registered in global registries.
- Configuration projections: assertions that a lowered or constructed field equals the same value
  supplied by the test or checked-in config. Test validation, merge conflicts, observable behavior,
  or a real external wire translation instead.
- Permanently skipped tests or empty test files.
- Screenshot-only tests without behavioral assertions.
- "Does not raise" tests without a comment explaining why that is the contract.
- "Does raise" tests if the exception type is not part of the contract or an important regression signal.

Disposable smoke probes are different from checked-in tests. During development,
use scratch scripts, REPL snippets, or temporary local assertions to confirm
imports, object construction, or fixture wiring. Do not leave those as pytest
tests. Before a PR-ready commit, replace them with behavior assertions or delete
them.

String assertions are allowed when the string is the contract: a wire format,
machine-readable output, a downstream-parsed log line, or an exact user-facing
error promised by the API. Assert on structured fields when possible.

Command construction is rarely the contract. Prefer to run through the boundary
and assert the effect. If the command line is the contract, assert the parsed
argv or structured command object, not a substring in rendered shell text.

Exact dependency versions, default scalar values, and serialized configuration
text are not contracts by default. Test the compatibility behavior they enable.
Assert an exact value or representation only when external consumers depend on
it.

## Mocks And Fakes

Default to real behavior. Use mocks only at I/O boundaries:

- subprocesses such as `gcloud` or `kubectl`
- HTTP or remote APIs
- GCS, W&B, or other external services
- filesystem boundaries that would be slow, expensive, or destructive

Prefer fakes over mocks when practical: in-memory services, temp directories,
local clients, fake schedulers, and fake clocks. Check module-specific docs for
existing fakes before adding a new one.

Do not mock internal functions to prove wiring. If a side effect matters, expose
or observe it through a public API or use a fake that records stable state.
If this is difficult, it may be a sign that you shouldn't test that behavior or that the API needs to be redesigned to make it testable without mocks.

## Timing

Do not use `time.sleep()` in tests. Inject `now=time.time()`, use a fake clock,
or use existing deadline/backoff helpers.

Use module-specific deadline, backoff, polling, or fake-clock helpers when they
exist. A single short sleep to let a background thread start is acceptable only
with a comment that names the race being avoided.

## Numerical Tests

Do not relax tolerances without human agreement. Exact tolerance values may be
module-specific; the global rule is that agents do not weaken them without
explicit agreement from the user.

Use module-specific slow-test markers and optional-dependency markers as
appropriate.

For kernels, start from an obvious reference: existing in-repo code, a PyTorch
reference, Optax/JAX baseline, or clear pseudocode. Check:

- value parity over a small shape/dtype grid
- gradient parity on small shapes
- CPU numerics and accelerator-aligned fast paths when applicable
- pointwise deviation metrics such as max and mean absolute difference, not only
  `allclose`
- If sharding is relevant, check parallelization and shard-local numerics separately.

Keep the reference independent and simple. A clever reference that shares the same bug as
the implementation is not useful.

## Pytest Style

- Prefer top-level `def test_*` functions with fixtures over test classes.
- Name tests as `test_<subject>_<scenario>_<expected_outcome>`.
- Use parameterization for meaningful behavior variation.
- Extend existing test files before creating new ones.
- Every test must contain an assertion or `pytest.raises`.
- Remove dead helpers, unused fakes, unused imports, and empty stubs.
- Mark slow, Docker, and cluster-dependent tests with the package's established
  markers.
- For non-trivial public classes with protocols, test the protocol behavior
  rather than concrete private state.

## Review Checklist

When reviewing tests, flag the test if the answer to any question is "yes":

- Would this test pass if the behavior were wrong?
- Would this test fail only because a helper was renamed or a log line changed?
- Is it asserting on private state, call counts, or internal dispatch?
- Does it duplicate the implementation instead of checking an independent
  oracle or observable behavior?
- Does it only mirror a scalar or config guard without a reported regression or
  compatibility-critical public contract?
- Does it pin an exact dependency version, default, or serialized config detail
  instead of the compatibility behavior that matters?
- Is the mock inside the system under test rather than at an external boundary?
- Does it sleep, skip permanently, or lack a real assertion?
- Did the change weaken a numerical tolerance or test expectation without justification?
- Does it ignore local `AGENTS.md` or module `TESTING.md` rules for markers,
  fakes, mocks, commands, optional dependencies, or integration boundaries?

Ask for low-value tests to be deleted or rewritten. More tests are not better
when they pin implementation details and miss real regressions.
