"""A launch's worth of records in the database an EvalDash journey drives.

The kernel serves the database ``MARINA_DATABASE_URL`` names. The records are the deterministic
fixture set, written to a temporary directory and reconciled into the app's schema before the
first EvalDash page loads, so the walk needs no network, no Iris, no finelog and no object
storage. The records prefix is pointed at when this module is collected: the kernel is shared
by every app's journeys and may already be serving by the time EvalDash's fixtures run.
