"""Hero-run enrollment shared by the training alert projections.

A root job is a hero run while its latest `iris.task_state` row is fresh and
reports a running task. It belongs to `/marin` and its last path component is
`<run-id>-coord` or `<run-id>-coord-<retry>`, where `<run-id>` begins with
`hero-`. This naming contract also gives the exact `run_id` in its Levanter telemetry. See
docs/ops/training-stall-alert-contract.md.

Recent Levanter `phase` telemetry is the second path. The run-health projections
watch the union, so an outage on one side leaves the other watching. A separate
exact-run query recovers the current execution for an Iris-active run whose
heartbeat is already stale. See docs/ops/hero-run-health-alerts.md.
