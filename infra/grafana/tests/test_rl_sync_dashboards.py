"""The sync RL boards' panels, read through the bridge from the rows MarinSkyRL actually publishes.

The fixture is built from the emitting code rather than from the panels: driver spans carry
``clock_domain='inclusive_wall'`` and no rank, worker spans carry a rank and one of two clock
domains, and the two ranks are constructed so that a per-phase maximum across them would exceed
the parent it is supposed to decompose. That is the mistake these panels exist to avoid, so it is
the one the fixture makes available.

``WorkerTimingSink._clock_domain`` composes the worker domain from the containment and the
synchronise mode: ``exclusive_wall`` with ``trainer.policy_train_spans_synchronize``, and
``exclusive_launch`` without it. Both are fixtured, because a panel that names only one renders
empty on every run made the other way and reads exactly like a producer that stopped publishing.
