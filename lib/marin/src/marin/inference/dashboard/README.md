# Marin serve dashboard

Vue app behind the `marin-serve` browser dashboard. `rsbuild` builds it into a
single self-contained HTML file (scripts and styles inlined, no CDN), committed
as the sibling `../serve_dashboard.html` and served by
`dashboard_server.py` via `importlib.resources`. The single-file artifact
is what lets the dashboard ship unchanged through both serve paths — the
bundled workspace and the PyPI `marin-core` wheel.

```bash
npm install
npm run build          # rebuild ../serve_dashboard.html (commit the result)
npm run build:check    # vue-tsc, tests, then build
npm run dev            # local dev server (relative /v1, /info, /health fetches
                       # need a Marin serve dashboard server behind it)
```

After editing anything under `src/`, rerun `npm run build` and commit the
regenerated artifact alongside the source change.

## Compare models

Open **Compare** from a Marin serve dashboard, then paste the second model's
dashboard URL. Both URLs must have the same browser origin, such as two Iris
capability URLs on one controller. The shared composer sends each prompt to
both endpoints. Each model receives its own prior messages on later turns.
For any completed turn, select **Left is better**, **Right is better**, **Tie**,
or **Both bad**. Click the selected choice again to clear it. The latest paired
transcripts and selections are stored in the same browser's local storage as
chat history. **New comparison** clears them. The second endpoint URL is not
stored because its capability token grants access to that server; reconnect it
after reloading the page to continue the saved comparison. No selection is
sent to a server.

## Chat template controls

The Chat view's **More settings** panel exposes two arguments to the active
model template. **Thinking** sends `enable_thinking=true`, sends
`enable_thinking=false`, or omits the argument for the model default. Marin's
current template renders those boolean values as `/think` and `/nothink`.
**Custom template instructions** sends `custom_instructions`; Marin's current
template places it in an auxiliary system header. Other templates may interpret
or ignore these arguments. This differs from **System prompt**, which adds a
normal `role: "system"` message to the conversation transcript.

The dashboard does not expose raw `xml_tools`, `python_tools`, or `tools`
template arguments. Functions entered in **Python tools** are converted to the
standard OpenAI `tools` request field so the served model's active template
formats them.

When a reply reaches **Max tokens**, Chat warns that it may be incomplete. This
applies whether the model stopped during thinking or after starting an answer.
Increase **Max tokens** and retry the prompt.

Enable **Raw chat** above the Chat composer to replace the rendered messages
with one plain-text transcript of the entire chat. The transcript includes the
system and user messages, unparsed assistant `content` and reasoning fields,
structured tool calls, tool results, and errors. The OpenAI-compatible response
does not include numeric token IDs, so the dashboard cannot display those.

Enable **vLLM debug** beside Raw chat to record request stats on each assistant
reply. Open **Request stats** below a reply to see server-reported time to first
token (TTFT), queue time, generation time, mean inter-token latency (the average
gap between generated tokens), output tokens per second, and prompt/output token
counts. The checkbox is off by default. It works with streaming and buffered
chat responses. The dashboard requests usage at the end of a streaming chat
response only while the checkbox is enabled. Stats are saved with the browser's
conversation history but are excluded from Raw chat and shared-chat links.

Start the serving process with `--vllm-arg=--enable-per-request-metrics` to
receive timings. The foldout explains when the server does not return them; token
counts still appear when the response includes usage. A single-token response
can have no mean inter-token latency.

## Rendered output and shared chats

Assistant messages render Markdown. Unfenced HTML and XML from the model are
displayed as literal text instead of DOM elements. The Markdown parser places a
raw markup region in a code block when it classifies the region as a block;
tags embedded in prose remain inline. This preserves custom tags such as
`<ticket_analysis>` and prevents model output from adding active HTML to the
dashboard.

Choose **Share chat** to store a snapshot in the dashboard process and copy a
link whose URL fragment contains its 16-character ID. The link length does not
grow with the transcript. The snapshot includes the title, model name, user and
assistant message text, and assistant errors. It excludes reasoning, tool calls,
tool results, the system prompt, custom template instructions, Python tool
source, shell workspace, and unparsed raw protocol fields. The share operation
does not redact excluded data that was copied into included message text or an
error.

The UTF-8 JSON request body for each snapshot is limited to 512 KiB. An
oversized snapshot is rejected, and the share button reports **Copy failed**.
The dashboard process retains the newest 128 snapshots in memory. A snapshot is
unavailable after it is evicted or the serving process restarts. Opening a valid
link fetches the snapshot from the same dashboard process, saves it in that
browser's conversation history, and removes the ID fragment from the address
bar. A missing or invalid ID opens an empty chat and displays an import error.

The snapshot ID is not a credential. Retrieval requires the dashboard URL that
contains the Iris capability token. That token authorizes the routes for one
`marin-serve iris` serving endpoint, including inference, tool, and shared-chat
requests. The command that mints the URL prints its expiration time. Share chat
links only with trusted users. The share operation grants the same access as the
current dashboard URL; it does not narrow or revoke that access.

## Custom Python tools

Open **Python tools** above the Chat composer to define functions for the active
conversation. The source is stored with the conversation in browser storage.
The two Python-tool cards on an empty chat populate the editor with working
examples and send a prompt that asks the model to use them.

Tool source may contain only top-level function definitions. Every parameter
and return value must be typed; positional-only parameters, `*args`, `**kwargs`,
keyword-only parameters, decorators, and asynchronous functions are rejected.
Annotations may use `bool`, `float`, `int`, `str`, `object`, `None`, lists,
string-keyed dictionaries, and `|` unions. Defaults must be JSON literals.

```python
def lookup_weather(city: str, units: str = "celsius") -> dict[str, object]:
    """Return the current weather for a city."""
    return {"city": city, "units": units, "temperature": 21}
```

Before each user turn's first model request, the dashboard converts each
function signature and docstring to an OpenAI-compatible JSON tool definition.
It sends those definitions in the request's `tools` field, so the tokenizer's
active tool-aware chat template controls the model prompt. The serving process
also reports that template's reasoning and tool-call delimiters to the browser.
For example, the Datakit template emits:

```xml
<tool_call>{"name":"lookup_weather","arguments":{"city":"Paris"}}</tool_call>
```

The Delphi template instead uses `<|tool_call|>` and
`<|tool_call_end|>`, while Llama-style templates emit a bare JSON object with
`name` and `parameters`. The UI parses the format selected from the served
model's template, runs each call in the Iris service, and adds the call and
result to the next request as structured `tool_calls` and `role: "tool"`
messages. The same template then renders the result in its trained format.
The server derives schemas from the function syntax without executing the
source. Pydantic validates arguments before each call and the return value
afterward. Each call runs in a fresh ShellSim environment that cannot access
the host filesystem, processes, network, environment variables, or clock. The
simulation is limited to 10 million CPU ticks, 64 MiB of memory, 4 MiB of disk,
and 1 MiB of output. An outer worker also enforces a 10-second wall timeout,
and source is limited to 64 KiB. ShellSim implements a source-compatible subset
of Python rather than full CPython, so unsupported modules and language features
fail the tool call.

Within one user turn, each model response that contains one or more calls counts
as one tool round. **Max tool rounds** in **More settings** controls the number
of rounds in that turn. The default value, `0`, allows unlimited rounds. For a
positive value, the UI executes calls from the final allowed round, stops before
another model request, and displays a limit error.

The UI also stops before executing the third identical tool call in a row. A
call is identical when its function name and arguments match; object key order
does not affect the comparison. Multiple calls in one response are checked in
execution order. A call with another function name or different arguments
resets the repetition count. The count resets at the start of each user turn.
Calls that return tool errors still count because the UI records the call before
execution.

## ShellSim agent workspaces

Open **Shell workspace** above the Chat composer to give the model a
conventional `bash` tool backed by an isolated ShellSim filesystem. Initial
files are a JSON object whose keys are relative paths and whose values are UTF-8
text. Enabling a workspace adds the standard function definition to the
request's `tools` field, so the served model's active chat template controls how
shell calls and results are rendered just like custom Python tools. The three
agent cards on an empty chat demonstrate repairing code, investigating a log,
and updating a configuration.

For manually entered files, ShellSim starts in `/work` with a fresh Git baseline
commit. Cloned workspaces recreate the imported commits described below. The
browser stores each executed command with the conversation. For the next call,
the service reconstructs the filesystem and replays those commands before
executing the new command, which preserves file edits and Git state without
keeping a host process or directory alive. Editing the initial
files JSON in the dashboard clears imported Git history and command replay
history. Choosing **Reset commands** clears only command replay history. The
simulated Git supports local agent workflows including status, diffs, branches,
commits, tags, merges, stashes, cherry-picks, rebases, blame, and reflog.
Networked Git commands are unavailable inside the workspace.

To start from an existing project, enter a public GitHub repository URL and
choose **Clone public repo**. That explicit action performs one shallow,
networked clone on the dashboard server. The service translates up to 32 recent
first-parent commits into bounded ShellSim-native commits, then deletes the
temporary clone. The model can use local commands such as `git log`, `git show`,
`git diff`, and `git blame` against the imported text history without another
network request. Merge topology, tags, binary and oversized file changes, and
older commits are not imported. The service does not forward credentials, load
submodules, retain a remote or `.git` directory, or support private
repositories.

Workspace inputs are limited to 500 files, 256 KiB per file, and 4 MiB total.
Repository clones are limited to 64 MiB and 30 seconds. Imported history is
limited to 32 commits and approximately 4 MiB of text changes; older commits
are dropped first when necessary. Binary files and common generated directories
such as `node_modules`, `.venv`, `target`, and `__pycache__` are skipped. A
conversation may replay at most 32 commands totaling 128 KiB; each command is
limited to 16 KiB. Each simulation is limited to 50 million CPU ticks, 64 MiB
of memory, 16 MiB of disk, and 2 MiB of output, with the same 10-second outer
worker timeout used for custom Python tools.

After the endpoint becomes ready, `marin-serve iris` prints a capability URL.
Possession of that URL authorizes inference and simulated Python tool calls.
It also authorizes ShellSim commands and bounded public GitHub clones. Share
the URL only with trusted users and treat it as a credential.
