"""Eval statistics: what a run measured, over how many items, and how uncertain the answer is.

A benchmark score is a mean over a finite item set, and a run does not always grade every item it set
out to grade. This module carries both facts as one type -- :class:`Measurement` holds the sufficient
statistics (scored items, binary successes or recorded dispersion, and the coverage of the attempted
panel) and the intervals are derived on read, so changing the interval rule never requires re-deriving
stored data.

The estimand is fixed once: **theta, the mean score over the items the run set out to grade.** With
``c = n_scored / n_attempted``, ``theta = c * theta_obs + (1 - c) * theta_miss``. ``theta_obs`` is
estimated from the graded items; ``theta_miss`` is not identified -- a trial that times out is more
likely to be a hard trial -- so it is bounded rather than imputed, and the reported interval widens by
at least ``1 - c``. Admitting a partial item set therefore costs interval width proportional to what
was missed, which is the whole point: a complete-case rate (``k / n_scored``) rewards a run for losing
the items it found hardest, so nothing here ranks on it.

Coverage has two denominators. ``n_attempted / n_benchmark`` says how much of the benchmark the run
set out to grade and gates admission; ``n_scored / n_attempted`` says how much of that it graded and
widens the interval. A one-item run of a 1319-item benchmark passes the second and fails the first.

Nothing here knows what a harness writes: :mod:`marin.evaluation.eval_measurements` turns records into
measurements, and this module takes them from there. It depends only on the evaluation record and
archive contracts, with no training, Levanter, or Iris imports.
