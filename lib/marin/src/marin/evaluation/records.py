"""The canonical eval-run record and its object-store layout.

One eval launch writes one ``record.json`` under ``{prefix}/{run_id}/record.json``: the durable,
self-describing account of what model was evaluated on what hardware, whether it succeeded, and the
per-task metrics it produced. The record is the source of truth; evaldash builds its query index from
these object-store records. Runs use an ``evals`` prefix in the platform-local object store.

This module is import-light on purpose -- the filesystem layer plus Pydantic, with no
marin/levanter/iris imports -- so it can be vendored into the dashboard image that reads records back.
