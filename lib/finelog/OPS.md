# Finelog Operations

## Access through the Iris IAP endpoint

The Iris controller exposes its finelog server as the `/system/log-server`
endpoint. For `iris.oa.dev`, the public path prefix is
`https://iris.oa.dev/proxy/system.log-server/`.

Authenticate once with the built-in Marin desktop OAuth client (it is
registered as an IAP programmatic client):

```bash
uv run iris --cluster marin login
```

The command caches a refresh token in `~/.config/marin/credentials/marin.json`.
That refresh token mints a short-lived ID token without opening the browser
again:

```bash
IAP_TOKEN="$(uv run python -c 'from rigging.credentials import iap_edge_provider; print(iap_edge_provider("marin").get_token())')"
curl --fail-with-body \
  --header "Proxy-Authorization: Bearer ${IAP_TOKEN}" \
  https://iris.oa.dev/proxy/system.log-server/health
```

IAP consumes `Proxy-Authorization`. Use `Authorization` separately if the
target Iris route also requires an Iris JWT.

The endpoint proxy replaces `/` in endpoint names with `.`. Use
`system.log-server` for `/system/log-server`; `/proxy/system/finelog` addresses
a different endpoint and does not reach finelog.

The finelog CLI uses the same cached credentials when its deployment config
sets `client_url`:

```bash
uv run finelog query marin 'SELECT * FROM "iris.profile" LIMIT 10'
```

`query` prints JSONL by default. Pass a short query as one shell-quoted
argument. Feed multiline SQL on stdin so SQL quotes do not need shell escaping:

```bash
uv run finelog query cw-us-east-08a <<'SQL'
SELECT task_id, attempt_id, max(memory_peak_mb) AS peak_mib
FROM "iris.task"
WHERE task_id LIKE '/power/example/%'
GROUP BY task_id, attempt_id
ORDER BY peak_mib DESC
SQL
```

List every namespace with its schema, index policy, retention overrides, and
current storage statistics as JSONL. Fetch one schema as formatted JSON:

```bash
uv run finelog namespaces cw-us-east-08a
uv run finelog schema cw-us-east-08a iris.task
```

Schema output includes `seq` under `implicit_columns`. Finelog assigns this
column to every row; producers do not declare it, but SQL queries can select it.

## Diagnosing query latency

Inspect the namespace before changing its policy or resetting it. Record its row
count, bytes, segment count, key column, and policy from `ListNamespaces`; a
correct key with many segments points to a different problem than a
misconfigured key. Do not reset a shared namespace such as `telemetry_v1` without
checking which producers use it.

Use native timestamp comparisons for timestamp columns. For telemetry's epoch-millisecond column, keep the predicate numeric:

```sql
WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
-- telemetry_v1
WHERE timestamp_ms >= CAST(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM now() - INTERVAL '5 minutes') * 1000 AS BIGINT)
```

DataFusion folds `now()` to a literal and can push the resulting range into
Parquet pruning. `epoch_ms` is a column in Finelog's `log` namespace, not a
timestamp conversion function.

For a bounded query that is still slow, run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and compare
`row_groups_pruned_statistics`, `bytes_scanned`, `metadata_load_time`, and
`time_elapsed_opening`. High metadata/opening time with few scanned bytes means
row-group pruning worked and file metadata is the remaining cost. The
`*_eval_time` metrics are accumulated elapsed time across concurrent per-file
tasks, not CPU time, so they overlap and do not sum to wall clock — treat a large
one as a place to look, not as a measured cost.

`EXPLAIN` itself can be slow when planning reads large trigram sections. If
`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` reports little scan time and few scanned bytes, compare its
wall time with plain `EXPLAIN` before tuning Parquet reads. For predicates on
several indexed columns, Finelog checks range-constrained columns first and
stops reading a segment's other index sections once its span mask is empty.
Before loading trigram sections, bounded integer predicates also exclude cached
local segments using complete Parquet min/max statistics. Missing source files
or statistics retain the segment for the ordinary scan. The planner retains
each segment's computed span mask through source planning, so a cache eviction
does not cause a second index load for the same query.

For log searches, `epoch_ms` is not the catalog key: `log` is keyed by task
`key`. A time bound can therefore still require footer reads for old segments.
When a known sequence window is available, bound `seq` as well to exclude
segments from catalog metadata before either footer or index reads.

An unbounded substring query (`col LIKE '%…%'`) prunes only when that column
carries a trigram index; otherwise it decodes the column for every row in the
namespace. `ListNamespaces` reports which columns are indexed. How much it prunes
depends on the pattern's literal runs: `%CUDA_ERROR%` only requires `CUDA` and
`ERROR`, so any row group holding both survives, where `%CUDA\_ERROR%` — or
`contains(data, 'CUDA_ERROR')` — gives the index the whole string. Escape the
underscores when you mean them literally. Adding one is a
`RegisterTable` away and does not need a reset, but the index backfill runs a
few segments per namespace per 30 s tick, so a large namespace speeds up over
tens of minutes rather than at once. Enabling a column supersedes the whole
`.fidx` policy, so every segment's bundle is rebuilt rather than extended: budget
one core across the namespace's full segment count.

That escaping rule is specific to `LIKE`. Equality already treats underscores
as ordinary characters, so use the stored metric name without backslashes:

```sql
WHERE name = 'grad_norm_layers_0_ln2_b'
```

`name = 'grad\_norm\_layers\_0\_ln2\_b'` asks for a different string and cannot
use postings declared for the unescaped name.

An unindexed substring predicate spends its cost in the `LIKE` kernel, not in
IO. `bytes_scanned` stays small while `pushdown_rows_pruned` reaches the
namespace's row count. Read both.

For repeated equality families, declare the hot string values in
`ColumnIndex.exact_values`. Finelog stores exact source-row postings in the
segment's `.fidx` bundle. The planner attaches them for `=` and same-column
`IN`/`OR` predicates when they retain at most 25% of the segment; denser matches
keep the contiguous source scan. The bundle header records the values covered by
each exact section, so a query for an undeclared value skips the postings payload
instead of opening and decoding it. Bundles written before this coverage header
remain queryable by scan and are rebuilt by the normal index backfill.

Use a named `Schema.projections` entry when the recurring query also benefits
from a compact physical copy. Each projection declares one predicate and an
explicit included-column list. Covered segments substitute the narrow Parquet
file while uncovered segments use postings or source Parquet, so partial
backfill is useful. `telemetry_v1` has a `training-status` projection for three
dashboard metric names and a `training-process-zero` projection for rows whose
`process_index` is `0`. The latter covers the structured columns used by the
training loss window query. `process_index = '0'` and `name = 'train_loss'`
also have exact postings when a segment has not completed projection backfill.

Change a projection in place; do not version its name. Re-registering a name
with a different predicate or column list supersedes the registered definition:
new segments build the new one, existing segments stay queryable under the
definition they were written with (each `.fidx` section carries its own
coverage), and the backfill rebuilds them a few per tick and deletes the
superseded Parquet files. A widened copy under a second name leaves both being
built for every new segment forever.

The `session-discovery` projection contains `num_requests_running` telemetry
with the structured `job_id`, `run_id`, and `execution_uid` columns plus the
metric attributes and timestamp. Standalone vLLM and embedded SkyRL scrapes
emit this current-snapshot gauge while they are observable. Inference dashboard
selectors filter by this exact name and, for SkyRL, by
`json_get(attributes_json, 'metric_source') = 'vllm'`. Keeping the time bound on
these rows makes the picker mean “observed in the selected window,” including
long-lived sessions whose start predates that window. The exact name posting
accelerates uncovered segments while the projection backfills through normal
index maintenance.

For broad low-cardinality summaries, set `ColumnIndex.value_counts`.
Unfiltered `SELECT col, count(*) FROM table GROUP BY col` and `count(col)` then
rewrite to a `FinelogIndexAggregate` node that combines exact per-segment
summaries without opening Parquet. `EXPLAIN` shows the rewrite. It is
all-or-nothing and limited to one grouping column; filters, joins, multiple
aggregates, a per-segment column above 4,096 distinct values, or a combined
result above 16,384 values use DataFusion.
`telemetry_v1` enables this for `service`, `kind`, and `name`, while its
training-status metric names also use an exact filtered projection.

`policies.rs` is the ordered registry for programmable schema policies. The
first matching rule owns logical routing, retention, and optional hidden
partitioning for that namespace family. Schemas without a matching rule keep
identity ingestion and the cluster's default storage policy.

The `/v1/telemetry` protocol remains for automatically sampled service state. It
accepts resource and record data, not a caller-selected namespace. Finelog gives
the complete normalized Arrow batch to the telemetry policy, which classifies
rows by service and metric name. Node-agent samples go to
`telemetry_v1.node_agent`; Iris controller `rpc_` and `proxy_` samples go to
`telemetry_v1.iris.rpc`; vLLM samples go to `telemetry_v1.vllm`; and an unmapped
service receives a normalized `telemetry_v1.<service>` namespace. Levanter NCCL
RAS samples remain automated telemetry in `telemetry_v1.levanter`.

Levanter's explicitly collected training values use the generic typed-table API
instead. A writer registers `levanter.metrics.<run_id>` and includes the same
`run_id` in every row. Finelog rejects a mismatch, then canonicalizes the alias
to the one SQL table `levanter.metrics`. The suffix is a writer assertion, not a
server-maintained list or a separate SQL schema. Legacy Levanter gauge rows sent
through `/v1/telemetry` are recognized from their complete record and converted
to the same typed metric table while clients roll out.

`levanter.metrics` version 1 is unpartitioned. Its Parquet order is
`(run_id, name, step, timestamp_ms, seq)`, which clusters the deployed exact
`run_id` and metric-name filters without rewriting the active object set to add
partition metadata. The static exact-`run_id` policy remains relevant only to
legacy-local compaction. Adding an object-native partition requires a later
table-spec version and a separately justified migration.

`levanter.metrics` intentionally has no secondary indexes. Its run-first
Parquet order and row-group statistics serve deployed selectors without
telemetry's `name` trigram, `kind` postings, or adaptive string value counts.
Server-owned registration removes the old declarations, queries ignore old
`.fidx` bundles, and bounded maintenance deletes those derived files online.
Source Parquet remains authoritative throughout cleanup.

Object-backed maintenance treats all unpartitioned files at one nonterminal
level as a sparse stream. Sequence gaps and overlapping footer ranges therefore
cannot split a level into sub-threshold runs and strand aggregate debt. The
planner promotes the shortest prefix reaching either the level's compressed-byte
target or its 32-segment cap; L3 is terminal. Partitioned table specs still form
one independent stream per exact partition. Each cycle executes at most one
object compaction and resumes after 100 ms while progress remains, returning to
the 30-second cadence at quiescence. Publication atomically replaces exact input
paths under the table's writer fence, so concurrent flushes can rebase and a
failed commit leaves all inputs live.

`telemetry_v1` exposes stable resource dimensions as nullable columns:
`run_id`, `job_id`, `execution_uid`, `region`, `node_name`, and `process_index`.
Producers may send them directly in the request's `resource`
object. When omitted, Finelog infers them from same-named resource attributes.
An explicit field wins over an attribute and replaces the same key in
`resource_attributes_json`; the JSON map is canonicalized rather than retaining
both conflicting values. Selectors and groupings should use the structured
columns.

An existing `telemetry_v1` root retains up to 50 GiB until migration
retirement; a retired or fresh store does not recreate that table.
Semantic namespaces have independent limits: typed Levanter metrics and
Levanter automated telemetry each have 32 GiB, node-agent telemetry has 15 GiB,
Iris RPC has 1 GiB, vLLM has 2 GiB, and other telemetry services have 2 GiB.
All `levanter.metrics` objects share its retention budget.

### Migrate the root telemetry hot set

`finelog-migrate` rewrites the `telemetry_v1` hot set inside the existing hub
store. It uses the same full-batch schema policy as HTTP ingestion and
forwarding. Start with the hub in `dual-write` migration mode; do not enable the
mode on forwarding `cw-*` stores. A forwarding store continues to send its one
root copy, and the hub writes that batch once to the root and once to its
semantic destination.

The first dual-write startup records
`.finelog-telemetry-v1-migration/dual-write-fence.json` before the listener
binds. Its `legacy_max_seq` is immutable across restarts. Migration selects root
rows at or below this fence, including when compaction puts pre- and post-fence
rows in one Parquet. Rows above the fence already have a semantic copy and must
not be migrated again.

The migrator rejects stores with forwarding cursors, so run it on the `marin`
or `marin-dev` hub, not a `cw-*` sender. Preparation may run while Finelog is
serving. It takes a consistent SQLite snapshot and hard-links exactly the local
root Parquets named by that catalog under
`.finelog-telemetry-v1-migration/source`. If compaction removes one during the
snapshot, preparation retries from a newer catalog. Rewritten Parquets land
under `.finelog-telemetry-v1-migration/staged` as flat, unpartitioned L0s with a
negative `seq` range disjoint from live ingestion. After publication, ordinary
runtime maintenance performs the L0-to-L1 partitioning and bounded physical
placement described above.

```bash
finelog-migrate prepare-telemetry-v1 \
  --store-dir /var/cache/finelog

finelog-migrate verify-telemetry-v1 \
  --store-dir /var/cache/finelog
```

Planning reads the catalog and Parquet footers and writes the initial manifest
before conversion starts. If one compacted segment crosses the dual-write
fence, planning reads only its `seq` column to obtain an exact input row count.
It does not classify, checksum, or partition records. Treat planning over a
local hot store as a sub-second operation; stop and investigate filesystem or
catalog access if the plan itself takes longer. The conversion first builds a narrow historical-step index from
the immutable source snapshot, then gives complete record batches to the schema
policy. This is necessary because compacted telemetry is sorted by metric name,
not by event time. The policy resolves the latest preceding step by execution,
process, timestamp, and sequence, regardless of the physical Parquet row order.
Rows before an execution's first observed step retain `NULL`.

Conversion updates the manifest after each source segment is durable. A
completed manifest records every source checksum, destination sequence range,
row count, stable row-identity checksum, output checksum, and the source catalog
checksum. Re-running preparation resumes from verified completed source
segments. `verify-telemetry-v1` rereads the source snapshot and every staged
Parquet, then records `verified_at_ms` in the manifest. Publish refuses a staged
manifest without that marker. Wrap operational invocations in an explicit
deadline; the current hot-store rehearsal completed preparation in under two
minutes:

```bash
timeout 15m finelog-migrate prepare-telemetry-v1 \
  --store-dir /var/cache/finelog
timeout 5m finelog-migrate verify-telemetry-v1 \
  --store-dir /var/cache/finelog
```

Publish is the first short cutover. Stop Finelog, publish, and restart it:

```bash
timeout 2m finelog-migrate publish-telemetry-v1 --store-dir /var/cache/finelog
```

Publish hard-links the staged Parquets into their semantic namespace directories
and replaces a catalog derived from the latest live catalog. It leaves the
root namespace queryable. Old root-only queries and new semantic-only queries
therefore each see one complete copy: migrated rows cover `seq <= legacy_max_seq`,
and dual writes cover later rows. A root-plus-semantic union would count them
twice. Deploy the semantic-only Grafana and Iris queries after publish.
Publish trusts the completed pre-cutover verification: while Finelog is stopped,
it only hard-links the staged files, builds and swaps the catalog, and checks the
new catalog rows before recording the phase. It does not reread Parquet contents
or recompute checksums. After the server restarts, ordinary compaction may replace
those L0 paths; subsequent verification checks the immutable staged outputs and
registered semantic namespaces instead of requiring the original live filenames.

Once those queries are live, stop Finelog for the second short cutover:

```bash
timeout 2m finelog-migrate retire-telemetry-v1 --store-dir /var/cache/finelog
```

Retirement moves root local files into the migration rollback directory and
replaces the catalog again, removing the old namespace and its remote-only
catalog rows. A restart does not recreate the root. The pre-cutover catalogs
stay under the `rollback` subdirectory; the hard-linked source snapshot stays
under `source`. Keep the migration directory until the new layout has passed
the training, cluster-capacity, RPC, and vLLM dashboard checks. Do not run
publish or retirement while a Finelog process has the catalog open; the store
lock rejects either command if it is.

The rollout order is:

1. Set only the hub's `telemetry_migration_mode: dual-write`, deploy it, and
   confirm the startup log reports the durable fence. Leave forwarding stores
   unchanged.
2. Write a canary through the ordinary telemetry API and confirm it appears
   exactly once in both root and its semantic namespace.
3. Run `prepare-telemetry-v1` and `verify-telemetry-v1` on the serving hub under
   explicit timeouts. Continue canary writes during both commands.
4. Validate staged row accounting and representative root-versus-semantic
   queries. Stop the hub, run `publish-telemetry-v1`, and restart the same
   dual-write revision.
5. Deploy the semantic-only Grafana and Iris queries and verify the training,
   capacity, RPC, and vLLM panels.
6. Set the hub back to `telemetry_migration_mode: normal` and deploy it. A
   canary must now advance only its semantic namespace; the root must remain
   unchanged.
7. After an observation period, stop the hub, run `retire-telemetry-v1`, and
   restart it. Remove legacy Levanter inference only after direct typed clients
   are fully deployed.

`GET /api/segments?namespace=levanter.metrics&physical=true` reports each local
segment identity and `.fidx` section directory. Use it to distinguish incomplete
backfill from a planner miss. `GET /api/server` reports corrupt bundle and
section counters; either condition is a safe scan fallback but should trigger a
local rebuild investigation. A time bound remains the fastest containment:
telemetry namespaces are keyed on `timestamp_ms`, so bounded queries can prune
before any secondary method runs.

`finelog query` applies a client deadline just past the server's own 10s one.
Raise both with `--timeout` and `FINELOG_QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` if a query genuinely
needs longer.

Row groups are sized to hold a fixed number of *encoded* bytes, so a namespace of
narrow rows gets far fewer of them than one of wide log lines. Encoded rather
than in-memory bytes is what matters: a telemetry row compresses to ~8 bytes
against a log line's hundreds, so an in-memory target under-sizes worst exactly
where the fix is needed.

A schema can impose a `max_row_group_rows` bound from 16,384 through 1,048,576
and a multi-column `sort_columns` order. The compactor appends `seq` as the final deterministic
tie-breaker. `telemetry_v1` uses 128K-row groups and sorts by
`(service, run_id, name, timestamp_ms, seq)`, which clusters the common service,
run, metric-name, and time predicates while keeping `timestamp_ms` as the
retention key. Existing compacted telemetry files are not immediately rewritten
for this schema-only policy change. New flushes use the row ceiling, multi-input
compactions use the sort order, and single-input promotions preserve their input
layout. The share of old-layout files declines through normal compaction and
retention; complete convergence is not guaranteed without a layout-version bump.

Separately, each segment's footer carries the global layout revision it was
written with. A revision bump causes a maintenance pass to re-encode segments
still on an older revision, a couple per namespace per 30 s tick — otherwise a
a large namespace would keep its old row groups until eviction aged them out, which
occurs on a timescale set by the namespace's local-cache budget. The rewrite
keeps the filename and preserves the rows and their order, so it costs no
remote bandwidth: the archive keys objects by basename and only uploads segments
still marked `Local`. A rewritten segment's remote copy keeps the old layout
while holding the same rows. Schema-level sort-policy changes do not bump this
revision and therefore do not schedule that rewrite.

Watch it with the `rewrote segment layout` events, which report the before and
after byte size per segment. Confirm the era split before concluding a layout
change did or did not land — compare footer bytes for segments modified before
and after the deploy, since a whole-namespace average is dominated by whatever
has not been rewritten yet.

`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` reports `row_groups_pruned_statistics` as `<total> total`,
which is the count for the segments a query touched *after* any injected access
plan, so it doubles as the check on whether trigram pruning fired.

`query_metadata_cache_mb` in a deployment config overrides DataFusion's
process-wide Parquet metadata cache limit. Leave it unset to retain DataFusion's
default. Finelog logs the effective limit at query-engine startup; every slow
query warning also includes `metadata_cache_limit_bytes`,
`metadata_cache_size_bytes`, `metadata_cache_entries`, and
`metadata_cache_hits`. Compare warm-query latency and those fields before
retaining or increasing an override.

`query_index_cache_mb` bounds decoded `.fidx` headers and sections. Cache
entries are keyed by segment identity and section ID, charged by decoded heap,
and invalidated when backfill publishes a replacement bundle. Size it for the
active trigram, posting, and value-count working set rather than source Parquet
bytes.

`StoragePolicy` controls eviction of eligible uploaded segments from Finelog's
local cache. It is not a row-age retention guarantee and does not delete objects
from the remote archive.

## Onboarding a cluster onto the forwarding hub

`marin` is the hub: every other cluster's finelog forwards its rows there, so a
job federated to CoreWeave reads back from `iris.oa.dev`. A sender authenticates
with its own Ed25519 keypair — private half in Secret Manager, public half inline
in the hub's `jwt` auth layer.

Mint the keypair. The private half never touches the repo; the public half is not
secret and belongs in version control.

```bash
CLUSTER=cw-rno2a
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out "/tmp/$CLUSTER.pem"
openssl pkey -in "/tmp/$CLUSTER.pem" -pubout          # -> paste into marin.yaml

gcloud secrets create "finelog-$CLUSTER-signing-key" \
  --project=hai-gcp-models --replication-policy=automatic \
  --labels=component=finelog,purpose=forwarding
gcloud secrets versions add "finelog-$CLUSTER-signing-key" \
  --project=hai-gcp-models --data-file="/tmp/$CLUSTER.pem"
shred -u "/tmp/$CLUSTER.pem"
```

Then wire both ends. In `config/marin.yaml`, add a `jwt` key entry naming the
cluster and its public key. In `config/$CLUSTER.yaml`, add `forwarding:` with the
hub, the cluster name, and the pinned secret version:

```yaml
forwarding:
  target: https://finelog.oa.dev
  cluster: cw-rno2a
  signing_key: gcp-secret://projects/748532799086/secrets/finelog-cw-rno2a-signing-key/versions/1
```

The public key in `marin.yaml` must be the public half of `forwarding.signing_key` —
that pairing is what authenticates the sender, and a wrong key is a 401 on every
push. `forwarding.cluster` is the origin name the sender stamps on every forwarded
row; keep it equal to the hub key entry's `cluster` label so reads line up.

Roll the **hub first** (a sender whose key the hub does not yet trust gets 401),
then the sender. `deploy sync-secret` resolves `signing_key` from Secret Manager
on the operator's machine and updates the pod's `<name>-env` Secret, so whoever
runs it needs `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` on that secret. The Pulumi
stack references that existing Kubernetes Secret without reading its values.

```bash
uv run finelog deploy restart marin              # hub: gcp backend, in-place
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/coreweave-iris
export R2_KEY_ID=... R2_KEY_SECRET=...
uv run finelog deploy sync-secret "$CLUSTER"
uv run marin-deploy finelog rollout "$CLUSTER"
```

`marin-deploy finelog rollout` captures the active Deployment revision, runs the matching
Pulumi stack, and restores the captured ReplicaSet if the update or ingest
verification fails. Its rollout identity and image build stamp come from the
checked-out, content-addressed Git tree SHA. If only the Secret changed, replace
the pod using `kube_context`, `namespace`, and `name` from
`lib/finelog/config/$CLUSTER.yaml`, wait for the Deployment, then run `uv run
--frozen --package marin-finelog finelog deploy verify "$CLUSTER"`. See
[`infra/finelog/README.md`](../../infra/finelog/README.md) for preview, manual
rollback, and first-time stack adoption. Do not run the first update without the
import flag: the live PVC must be adopted, not recreated.

Forwarding starts at the sender's current watermark: rows already in its store
stay there and stay queryable, but they do not backfill into the hub.

Confirm the hub is receiving. The hub overwrites the `cluster` column with the
cluster bound to the verified JWT, so a row carrying the sender's name proves that
sender's forwarding reached the hub. Bound the scan by time — an unbounded `GROUP BY` over
the whole `log` namespace will time out. An empty `cluster` is the hub's own rows;
a sender missing from this list is a sender whose rows are not arriving.

```bash
uv run finelog query marin --format table \
  'SELECT cluster, count(*) AS rows FROM "log"
   WHERE epoch_ms > (extract(epoch from now()) * 1000 - 600000)
   GROUP BY cluster'
```

### Distinguishing missing regional logs from delayed hub forwarding

`FinelogRelayStalled` is the primary fleet alert for this distinction. Each
regional process sends a complete status snapshot directly to the hub every 30
seconds; the report does not pass through `WriteRows` or a telemetry table. Its
states mean:

- `heartbeat_missing` or `heartbeat_stale`: the hub has no current direct report
  from the cluster.
- `namespace_missing`: the required `telemetry_v1.node_agent` table is absent
  from an otherwise current complete snapshot.
- `publication_stalled`: locally visible sequence positions have not reached
  the published R2 catalog for ten minutes.
- `forwarding_stalled`: published positions have not advanced the hub-settled
  cursor for ten minutes.

The Grafana rule holds a classified failure for two more minutes before paging.
NoData and bridge/RPC errors alert rather than appearing healthy. On the
regional Finelog UI, the table's Forwarding card shows the same visible,
published, and settled boundaries for local diagnosis.

The regional Finelog is the record; the `marin` hub is an asynchronous copy. If
logs for a federated Iris task are absent from the hub, query the exact task key
on both stores before diagnosing the pod-side shipper. Iris task keys include the
attempt suffix, such as `:0`:

```bash
CLUSTER=cw-us-east-08a
KEY=/user/job/task:0

uv run finelog query marin --format table \
  "SELECT seq, epoch_ms, source, data, cluster FROM \"log\"
   WHERE key = '$KEY' AND cluster = '$CLUSTER' ORDER BY seq"
uv run finelog query "$CLUSTER" --format table \
  "SELECT seq, epoch_ms, source, data FROM \"log\"
   WHERE key = '$KEY' ORDER BY seq"
```

Interpret the pair as follows:

- Regional rows present and hub rows absent, only a prefix, or a non-prefix subset:
  forwarding is delayed or a batch was permanently rejected. Repeat the exact hub
  query, then inspect the forwarder warnings and `telemetry_v1.finelog` counters below.
  Do not classify an immediate empty result by itself as loss.
- Rows absent regionally but present in `kubectl logs <pod> -c task`: inspect
  `kubectl logs <pod> -c log-shipper` and the regional Finelog ingest path.
- Rows absent from both Finelog stores and the container runtime: the task did
  not emit the expected output or its runtime logs are already unavailable.

The forwarder gives every live namespace one batch-sized turn per round and
starts another round immediately while work remains. A large telemetry backlog
therefore does not monopolize forwarding ahead of new log rows. Hub or network
failures get three attempts, then leave the affected cursor in place and yield to
the next namespace. The same batch is retried on the next sweep; exhaustion does
not discard it.

The hub returns `failed_precondition` when a well-formed batch conflicts with its
registered schema. The sender preserves the cursor, clears its registration cache,
and retries after registration refresh. A persistent conflict pins that namespace's
cursor, holding later rows behind it until the schemas become compatible or local
retention evicts the blocked positions. If refresh does not clear the next sweep,
compare the source and hub registrations and deploy a compatible schema; do not reset
the cursor. Other namespaces continue forwarding.

The hub returns `invalid_argument` for malformed row content. The sender drops the
entire outbound chunk, including otherwise valid rows in that chunk, and advances its
cursor because resending the same bytes cannot succeed. The regional store remains the
source of record until retention evicts those rows. `forwarding_seq_positions` with
`outcome='permanent_rejection'` records the skipped sequence span.

Roll this status-code contract to the hub before regional senders. An older hub reports
registered-schema conflicts as `invalid_argument`, which a newer sender would treat as
permanent. Verify the hub build first, then roll the regional forwarders.

Inspect the sender's forwarder messages without changing the deployment. Read
the deployment name and Kubernetes connection details from
`lib/finelog/config/$CLUSTER.yaml`:

```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig <kubeconfig> --context <context> -n iris \
  logs deployment/<finelog-name> --since=30m --timestamps=true | \
  rg 'finelog forwarder'
```

Warnings name the affected namespace. `backlog exceeds the warning threshold`
reports pressure but does not change the forwarding cursor; the sender continues
processing retained rows without moving the cursor merely because of backlog pressure.
`object-native cursor precedes the live spool; refusing to skip rows` means the
cursor and live segment state disagree. The sender fails closed for that namespace;
inspect its selected HEAD and local projection instead of advancing the cursor.
`rows evicted before they were forwarded` applies only to a legacy relay whose
local retention already made source sequence positions unreadable.
`batch conflicts with the hub schema; preserving the cursor` means the sender will
re-register the namespace's current schema on the next sweep and retry the same rows.
`hub permanently rejected the batch; dropping it` means the hub classified the content
as invalid and the sender advanced the cursor. A current
hub also registers an unseen server-owned destination before appending telemetry
routed from the legacy `telemetry_v1` root. A `namespace ... is not registered`
rejection for such a destination means the hub predates that behavior or its managed
registration failed. The cumulative, process-lifetime `skipped_seqs` log field includes
permanent rejections and local-retention gaps and resets after restart.

Slow forwarding lines include the live and selected segment counts, rows,
visibility-lock wait, snapshot, planning, scan, encoding, hub acknowledgement,
settlement, and total milliseconds. A settlement line also reports removed
segment, row, and byte counts. Maintenance lines report resource class, queue
wait, run time, and the requested follow-up class. Object-backed relays use the
`RelayIo` class; `SpecMigration` and `QueryServing` have independent limits.

The forwarding cursor and fully covered object-segment removals share one
catalog transaction and one HEAD publication. Covered segments stop appearing
in relay queries immediately after settlement. Their objects remain through the
query and rollback retention window, then exact-release GC removes both the
remote object and local cache copy. The generic 24-hour orphan grace applies to
unselected uploads whose owning transaction is unknown, not to settled relay
segments.

State collection uses the selected catalog and its checkpoint-folded release
set. It lists historical catalog keys for age and selected-chain membership but
does not download them. CoreWeave S3 deletes up to 1,000 eligible keys per
request. The `collected object table state` event reports listed catalog keys,
selected-chain size, pending and deleted releases, deleted catalog keys, orphan
counts, and milliseconds for each stage. `historical_nodes_opened` must remain
zero.

Sequence positions measure cursor distance, not decoded row count. Gaps and rows
filtered because they already carry a foreign origin can make both `skipped_seqs` and
`forwarding_seq_positions` an upper bound on affected rows. Telemetry values are
five-minute deltas; an unreported partial interval is lost if the sender restarts.

Each regional sender writes five-minute delta counters to `telemetry_v1.finelog`; the
same forwarder copies them to the hub on a later successful sweep. Query dropped
positions across the fleet for the last hour with:

```bash
uv run finelog query marin --format table \
  'SELECT date_bin(INTERVAL '\''5 minutes'\'', to_timestamp_millis(timestamp_ms)) AS bucket,
          cluster,
          json_get(attributes_json, '\''namespace'\'') AS namespace,
          json_get(attributes_json, '\''outcome'\'') AS outcome,
          sum(value) AS seq_positions
   FROM "telemetry_v1.finelog"
   WHERE name = '\''forwarding_seq_positions'\''
     AND json_get(attributes_json, '\''outcome'\'') IN
         ('\''permanent_rejection'\'', '\''retention_eviction'\'')
     AND timestamp_ms > (extract(epoch from now()) * 1000 - 3600000)
   GROUP BY bucket, cluster, namespace, outcome
   ORDER BY bucket, cluster, namespace, outcome'
```

The Fleet health Grafana dashboard plots failed batches and dropped sequence positions.
`forwarding_batches` also exposes `schema_conflict` and `retryable_failure` outcomes.
Check `max(timestamp_ms)` for the sender before interpreting an empty hub result. During
a hub or network failure the diagnostic telemetry is also delayed; run the same query
against the regional target without a `cluster` predicate to inspect its local copy.

To rotate a key, add the new Secret Manager version, add its public key alongside
the old one under the same `keys[].cluster` (the hub accepts either), roll the
hub, re-pin the sender's `signing_key` to the new version, run `deploy
sync-secret`, update the sender's Pulumi stack, then drop the old public key and
roll the hub again.

## Checking that a server is ingesting

`/health` answers 200 whenever the process is listening, and it is also the
Kubernetes liveness, readiness, and startup probe, so it cannot fail on a
condition a restart will not clear. The body carries the verdict: `ok`, or
`degraded: <namespace>: registration failed: <reason>`.

The known semantic telemetry namespaces are registered on boot; an existing
root is registered only until it is retired. When the binary's schema and a
catalog entry disagree in a way no merge can reconcile
(a column type change), writes to that namespace return 400 until one of them
changes, across restarts.

```bash
curl -sf http://<host>:<port>/health          # ok | degraded: ...
curl -sf http://<host>:<port>/api/server | jq .ingest
```

`/api/server`'s `ingest` block names each namespace, its state, the error, when
it first failed, and how many attempts have been made since. The dashboard's
System page shows the same under **Ingest**. The GCE `deploy up`, `deploy
restart`, and `safe_deploy` paths gate on the body; `safe_deploy` rolls back a
failed GCE rollout. Kubernetes `marin-deploy finelog rollout` restores the captured
ReplicaSet when Pulumi's post-Deployment `finelog deploy verify` fails.

A disk-backed namespace rejects writes that would take its raw Arrow buffer
above 200 MiB. Connect clients receive `resource_exhausted`; HTTP telemetry
clients receive the existing 503 `storage_unavailable` response. Sustained
rejection indicates that the cache filesystem or storage backend is not keeping
up.

## Serving a copy of a store

Anything that boots finelog over a copy of a real store directory — the Grafana
dashboard benchmark, a layout experiment, reproducing a query — should pass
`--mode shadow`. The server serves reads from `--log-dir` and refuses a
`gs://`/`s3://` remote or a forwarding target at startup, and its store starts
no maintenance, so compaction, eviction, layout rewrites, and the boot
reconcile's redundancy drop (which deletes archived objects) never run against
the copy or the bucket it came from.

A shadow boot over a copy of a deployment's catalog also re-runs that
deployment's registrations, so a schema this binary can no longer merge shows
up in `/health` as `degraded: <namespace>: registration failed: ...` with the
per-namespace detail under `/api/server`.

## Diagnosing Kubernetes mirror readiness

Use the kubeconfig and context from `config/<cluster>.yaml`; do not rely on the
file's current context. Inspect the deployment, termination reason, probe events,
and persistent cache before changing resources:

```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/coreweave-iris --context <context> -n iris \
  describe pod -l app=finelog-<cluster>
kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/coreweave-iris --context <context> -n iris \
  logs deployment/finelog-<cluster> --previous --tail=300 --timestamps=true
kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/coreweave-iris --context <context> -n iris \
  exec deployment/finelog-<cluster> -- cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory.events
kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/coreweave-iris --context <context> -n iris \
  exec deployment/finelog-<cluster> -- df -h /var/cache/finelog
kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/coreweave-iris --context <context> -n iris \
  logs deployment/finelog-<cluster> --timestamps=true | \
  rg 'finelog (catalog sqlite ready|local segment adoption complete|namespace startup complete|store startup complete|remote reconcile complete)'
```

Exit 137 is ambiguous by itself. A nearby `Killing ... failed liveness probe`
event with zero `oom_kill` events means kubelet terminated an unresponsive
process; it was not a memory-limit OOM. Compare `memory.current` and
`memory.peak` with the configured limit, and compare cache use with the PVC
capacity before raising either. Slow `WriteRows` calls coincident with large
compactions indicate ingest pressure; tune `cpu_request`, `cpu_limit`,
`memory_request`, and `memory_limit` in the cluster's finelog config. Every
Kubernetes deployment also has a five-minute startup probe so reopening an
existing network-backed store does not feed a liveness restart loop.

The standalone `finelog-server` treats every Rust panic as process-fatal. Its
panic hook reports the first panic and aborts before Tokio can contain it as a
failed task. Kubernetes then restarts the container over the existing store and
PVC. Inspect `kubectl logs ... --previous` for the initiating panic and the pod's
restart count. A repeated deterministic panic becomes `CrashLoopBackOff`.
Do not recover a poisoned store mutex with `PoisonError::into_inner`; the panic
may have interrupted a state transition protected by that mutex. The PyO3
server embedded in Iris does not install this process-wide hook because an
abort would terminate the controller.

The startup events carry millisecond timings for SQLite open, one-time catalog
adoption, local directory discovery, catalog reads, Parquet footer reconciliation,
batched catalog refresh, namespace rehydration, and total store open. The catalog
event also reports the effective SQLite journal and synchronous modes. Remote
reconcile runs after the listener binds and reports object listing, footer fetch,
catalog update, and delete timings separately; a slow remote phase cannot explain
pre-bind readiness delay.
