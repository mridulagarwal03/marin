"""Mode mcq: the option letter the candidate wrote on its ``Answer:`` line.

Extraction is the nemotron_gym MCQA pattern, taking the last ``Answer: X`` in the output. Half of
the Nemotron prompts ask for ``Answer: \\boxed{X}`` and models also write ``**Answer:** (X)``, so
``\\boxed{}``, markdown emphasis, backticks, and brackets around the letter are dropped before
matching. The original verifier fell back to any trailing single letter when that pattern missed;
the fallback scores prose that never states an answer, so it is not reproduced here. Output with no
``Answer:`` line scores zero, as does a letter outside ``A``..the last option.
