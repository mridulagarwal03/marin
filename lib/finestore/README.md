# FineStore

FineStore is a small transactional store for immutable Parquet data on local disk,
GCS, and S3-compatible object storage. It covers workloads that need to batch many
small records or named byte objects without running a catalog service.

One conditional mutable object, `HEAD`, is the visibility boundary. It points to an
immutable manifest containing the complete active file set for every table. A
successful write returns the version of `HEAD` as a `CommitToken`. Readers resolve
`HEAD` once and keep that manifest for the lifetime of their `ReadView`.

## Transactions

Register table contracts on the store, then use a transaction when several tables
and objects must become visible together:

```python
from finestore.store import DataStore

with DataStore.open("gs://bucket/purchases", writer_id="worker-0") as store:
    store.table("purchases", primary_key=("order_id",))

    with store.transaction() as transaction:
        receipt_uri = transaction.write_object("receipts/o-1", b"paid")
        transaction.table("purchases").add(
            {"order_id": "o-1", "amount": 12, "receipt_uri": receipt_uri}
        )
        assert transaction.lookup("receipts/o-1") == b"paid"

    token = transaction.token
```

The transaction buffers its rows and object bytes in memory. Each participating
table produces one level-zero Parquet shard. FineStore writes every shard and an
immutable full manifest before it conditionally advances `HEAD`. Until that final
write succeeds, none of the transaction is visible. A caller should split a
transaction when its payload would exceed a safe process-memory bound.

Ordinary table appends use the same commit path. `store.flush()` atomically publishes
the currently claimed buffers from all registered tables. `table.flush()` publishes
only that table. If writing or publication fails, claimed store buffers are restored
for retry. Immutable files written before a failed publication are harmless orphans
and can be collected later.

## Reads

```python
from finestore.reader import ReadView

view = ReadView("gs://bucket/purchases")
purchase = view.point("purchases", order_id="o-1")
receipt = view.resolve(purchase["receipt_uri"])
token = view.token
```

A view pins one manifest. Commits and compactions that happen afterward do not change
its results. Create a new view to observe a newer token.

`scan` supports column projection and `==`, `!=`, and `in` filters. FineStore unifies
compatible Parquet schemas across active shards and keeps the row from the latest
user commit for each primary key before applying filters on non-key columns. Compaction
preserves each row's original commit sequence, so reorganizing files never makes an
older value outrank a concurrent write.

## Named objects and caches

`DataStore.write_object(name, data, metadata)` writes bytes into the reserved `blobs`
table and returns `finestore://blobs/<name>`. Named objects participate in the same
transaction and commit token as ordinary table rows.

Objects up to 8 MiB remain inline in the `blobs` row. Larger objects use an inline
descriptor plus 8 MiB rows in the internal `_finestore_blob_parts` table. The
descriptor and parts become visible in one manifest commit, and `ReadView.open_blob`
streams either encoding through one file interface. The first chunked-object commit adds the
`chunked-blobs-v1` required manifest feature, so an older reader fails closed instead
of returning a descriptor as an empty payload. Existing inline objects and archives
need no migration.

`write_object` still accepts a complete `bytes` value. `read_blob` remains the
convenience API that returns a complete `bytes` value, while `open_blob` returns a
forward-only binary file object for incremental reads. Chunk-count and declared-size
validation completes when the stream reaches EOF; closing it early intentionally skips
whole-object validation. Each part occupies its own Parquet row group, and blob scans
request one row with one batch of readahead, so a streaming reader does not materialize
all of an object's parts. File-set materialization streams committed parts into the
destination file to avoid another complete copy. A transaction's `max_bytes` limit
still applies; `FineStoreDirectory` treats its byte limit as a multi-file batch target
and admits one larger file.

Two adapters build cache behavior on this primitive:

- `finestore.cache.PersistentKvCache` stores serialized autotuning and compiled-kernel
  results by key. The process memory tier serves repeated reads. Remote writes queue in
  the background; each batch is bounded by value bytes and object count, then published
  in one transaction. Normal interpreter shutdown gives queued writes up to 10 seconds
  to finish. A stalled write is then abandoned so cache storage cannot hold process
  shutdown. `cache.close()` waits for queued writes when a caller wants deterministic
  resource cleanup.
- `finestore.fileset.FineStoreDirectory` materializes a committed named-object set
  into a local directory and publishes newly created files in payload-bounded batches.
  Iris uses it for XLA's per-fusion autotune directory, replacing the ZIP mirror.

Both adapters are caches: failures may be treated as misses by their callers. Cache
cleanup does not acknowledge persistence or return a commit token. Use
`DataStore.transaction()` when a write must become visible before the caller continues.
The core `DataStore` and `ReadView` APIs propagate storage and commit errors.

## Compaction

The store's maintenance thread flushes on its configured interval and uses bounded
leveled compaction. Level-zero shards are compacted after 16 active files, followed by
limits of 4 shards at levels one and two. Level three is terminal, so one maintenance
pass performs at most three compactions per table. `store.maintain()` exposes the same
operation for deterministic callers. `compact_table(root, table)` compacts all active shards
for explicit materialization and sealing.

Compaction pins a manifest, streams an ordered merge of its exact input shards, writes
one shard at the next level, and replaces those paths through the same `HEAD` compare
and swap. If another compactor removes an input first, the losing output remains
unreferenced and the operation is a benign no-op. If another writer adds a shard,
the replacement can rebase while preserving the new shard.

Compaction does not delete source objects. An older read view may still reference
them. Physical garbage collection needs a separate retention rule, such as sealed
archive retention or reader leases; it is outside the current API.

## Layout

```text
{root}/
    _archive.json                         format marker changed only by migrations
    HEAD                                  conditional commit pointer
    manifests/{commit_id}.json            immutable complete snapshots
    schemas/{content_hash}.json            immutable table contracts
    data/{table}/w={writer}/g={level}/... immutable Parquet shards
```

Only `HEAD` is mutable. The `HEAD` document names a manifest, commit id, and logical
sequence. A manifest names every active shard, its writer and compaction generation,
row and sequence bounds, byte size, SHA-256 digest, each table's metadata object, and
optional seal state. Writers compute shard integrity metadata while streaming Parquet,
so it does not require another object-store read.

Manifest models preserve unknown optional JSON fields when an older writer rebases a
commit. A manifest can also name `required_features`; readers reject features they do
not implement before exposing a view. This lets future optional metadata remain
additive while mandatory semantics fail closed without forcing unrelated archives to
change their format version.

Writable archives require real conditional object writes:

- local disk: `flock` plus a content version;
- GCS: object generations and `if_generation_match`;
- S3: ETags with `If-None-Match` or `If-Match`.

Other fsspec schemes are rejected for writes because last-writer-wins publication
cannot provide transaction atomicity. They may be added after their backend exposes
an equivalent compare-and-swap primitive.

## Recovery and lifecycle

- A process that stops before advancing `HEAD` leaves the previous commit intact.
- A process that stops after advancing `HEAD` completed the transaction.
- A cache writer may stop at either point. The named value is absent or fully committed;
  a partial transaction is never visible.
- A compare-and-swap loss reloads `HEAD` and rebases disjoint additions. A compaction
  rebases only while all of its exact inputs remain active.
- Opening a sealed archive for writing publishes a commit that clears its seal.
  `store.seal()` flushes, compacts, and records seal metadata in a final manifest.

Format migrations live in `finestore.migrations` as a linear revision chain. Each
`mNNNN_<name>.py` revision declares its source and target format versions and must be
safe to retry. `_archive.json` is the applied-version ledger, so a separate migration
table would duplicate the archive's visibility state.

Each revision also declares whether it is safe to run while opening an archive for
writing. `DataStore.open()` applies a complete chain only when every required revision
opts in. `ReadView()` never mutates storage; an older archive raises
`FormatVersionError` with instructions to call `finestore.migrations.migrate(root)`.
An archive from a newer FineStore build instructs either caller to upgrade the package.

`finestore.migrations.LegacyReadView(root)` is the explicit format-v1 compatibility
reader. It captures one listing of the v1 table shards, applies the same primary-key
supersession rules as `ReadView`, and reads sealed or unsealed archives without changing
them. Format v1 has no `HEAD`, so `LegacyReadView.token` is always `None` and a concurrent
writer can span the listing snapshot. Use it for transitional inspection and dashboards;
workloads that require an atomic multi-table snapshot must migrate to format v2.

The application that owns an archive runs migrations after quiescing its writers. For
evaluation archives, the fleet operator runs
`experiments.evaluation.migrations.cli upgrade-format` before deploying format-v2
readers. The v1-to-v2 revision is write-open-safe when the archive is sealed. A writable
open then publishes existing Parquet shards through an initial manifest and keeps the
legacy objects without copying payload data. Migration reads each payload once to bind
its byte size and SHA-256 digest into the v2 manifest. An unsealed archive still
requires the owner to quiesce and seal its writers first.

## Package boundary

`marin-finestore` contains storage, transactions, read views, compaction, generic cache adapters,
and the versioned `finestore.eval` schema and table API. Harbor and Evalchemy map their own native
formats into that contract and use the table API to write dashboard-ready `samples` and `steps`
without depending on `marin-core`. The contract also defines evaluator-neutral `rollouts_vN` rows
keyed by evaluation identity, turn, and part; Marin converts the evaluator-owned rows into the table
for the current schema version.
Evaldash reads the same schemas. Marin separately records each evaluation or RL attempt in Finelog's
`marin.rollout_runs` discovery table, with a URI pointing back to its rollout store. FineStore
contains no evaluator conversion policy, Finelog integration, or Marin pipeline dependency.

`finestore.rl.mismatch_probe` defines the frozen-response, scorer and manifest tables
shared by MarinSkyRL producers and Marin's mismatch reports. Tokenizer identity,
relative updates and absolute trainer steps are typed provenance fields. This
contract sits next to `finestore.eval` so producers need only `marin-finestore`
and CPU report readers need no trainer or inference-engine dependencies.
