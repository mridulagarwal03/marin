# TaskTrove conversion

This pipeline converts the pinned
[open-thoughts/TaskTrove](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-thoughts/TaskTrove) revision into
Harbor tasks with explicit grader contracts. It retains sources and rows that can be normalized
deterministically. `source_verdicts.json` records each source decision, and the release ledger
records every rejected row. `reviewed_defects.json` contains the small set of source/path pairs
whose task contract, golden, or grader failed manual review.

Each retained task contains:

- `instruction.md` and `task.toml`;
- `environment/Dockerfile` with the pinned verifier installed;
- `tests/test.sh`, which invokes `verifyit`;
- `tests/verifier.toml`, which declares one grader mode; and
- mode-specific hidden data under `tests/`.

`task_format.py` defines this layout. [`verifyit`](../../../lib/verifyit/README.md)
defines and executes the grader contract.

## Run

The release version and TaskTrove revision are constants in `pipeline.py`. The verifier commit
comes from Marin launch provenance. Commit and push converter and verifier changes before starting
a release; the pipeline rejects a dirty launch because task Dockerfiles fetch that commit from
GitHub.

```bash
# Print the pinned build plan.
uv run python -m experiments.post_training.tasktrove.pipeline

# Build the release or reuse its cached artifacts.
uv run python -m experiments.post_training.tasktrove.pipeline --run

# Build through one stage.
uv run python -m experiments.post_training.tasktrove.pipeline --stage templates --run
```

Update `PIPELINE_VERSION` for a new conversion release. Update `TASKTROVE_REVISION` and
`RAW_VERSION` together when the input revision changes. The generated Dockerfiles and release
manifest record the clean launch commit used to build the pipeline.

## Pipeline

| stage | module | result |
|---|---|---|
| `raw` | `dataset.py` | pinned source Parquet files, reshuffled into 64 working shards |
| `summaries` | `task_templates.py` | counts and file shapes grouped by normalized task template |
| `templates` | `task_templates.py` | exemplars plus converter coverage for retained sources |
| `converted` | `convert.py` | normalized task binaries, optional solution archives, metadata, and row status |
| `filtered` | `verify.py` | within-source exact deduplication and fail-closed verifier checks |
| `routing` | `mcqa_routing.py`, `mcqa_routing_pipeline.py` | GLM classifications and the managed routing artifact |
| `routed` | `apply_mcqa_routing.py` | verified rows looked up by task ID in the routing artifact |
| `release` | `publish.py` | Harbor tasks, MCQA RL/SFT splits, ledger, manifest, and report |

## Release layout

The release deliberately uses one Parquet file rather than Hive-style source partitions. Each row
is one retained task, and consumers can select a source, family, or other cohort from ordinary
columns before reading the packed task payloads.

| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| `path` | stable task identifier from the source dataset |
| `source` | original TaskTrove source name |
| `family` | broad conversion family assigned by `source_verdicts.json` |
| `template_id` | normalized source template identity |
| `converter` | converter that produced the task |
| `mode` | declared `verifyit` grader mode |
| `dockerfile_id` | normalized environment/Dockerfile identity |
| `language` | task language when the converter can determine it |
| `tags` | list of selection labels preserved or added during conversion |
| `has_solution` | whether the release includes a shipped oracle solution |
| `task_binary` | gzip-compressed Harbor task archive |
| `solution_binary` | optional gzip-compressed oracle solution archive |

The routing stage loads the complete `route-mappings.jsonl` artifact into memory and applies it as a
map-side lookup. MCQA rows routed to RL remain in `tasks/` and are also written to `rl/`. SFT rows
retain their task and solution archives in the separate SFT Parquet. Garbage rows and mechanically
valid MCQA rows absent from the mapping are rejected without payloads. Non-MCQA rows remain in
`tasks/`.

`tasks/part-00000.parquet` is the complete RL-compatible corpus with the previous release schema, so
existing Harbor, SkyRL, and Hugging Face consumers continue to read `tasks/` without configuration
changes. `rl/part-00000.parquet` contains only the MCQA rows newly routed to RL.

Each physical split is a single Parquet file. Source-specific files can be materialized from the
`source` column when needed; the canonical release stays single-shard per split so each has one
immutable object, one footer, and one row-count contract.

The current release is under
`s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin/tasktrove/clean/2026.09.18.3/`:

| path | contents |
|---|---|
| `tasks/part-00000.parquet` | compatibility view of the complete RL corpus with the previous schema |
| `rl/part-00000.parquet` | MCQA rows routed to RL, including route provenance and task payloads |
| `sft/part-00000.parquet` | MCQA rows routed to SFT, including route provenance and task payloads |
| `ledger.parquet` | rejected source and row decisions |
| `manifest.json` | counts by route, source, status, converter, grader, tag, and environment |
| `report.md` | tables generated from the manifest |

The authenticated browser at <https://marina.oa.dev/tasktrove/> uses a paginated Marina API. The
server reads the Parquet with its existing S3 credentials. Exact source-only pages use the
manifest's released count and scan row groups only until the requested page is full, avoiding a
cold full-column read. Other filters cache their columns, and every process keeps bounded
row-group, filter-result, and rendered-page caches. Task archives are read one at a time and are
not cached.

## Publish to Hugging Face

Publish a built release with an `HF_TOKEN` that can write to the destination dataset repository:

```bash
uv run python -m experiments.post_training.tasktrove.publish huggingface \
  s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin/tasktrove/clean/2026.09.18.3
```

The destination defaults to `open-athena/task-trove`; pass `--repo-id organization/dataset` to
choose another repository. The command streams each release object into a temporary local staging
directory, uploads task shards under `data/`, and puts `ledger.parquet`, `manifest.json`, and a
generated dataset card at the repository root. The card configures only `data/*.parquet` as the
`train` split, so the rejection ledger remains downloadable metadata instead of becoming a second
dataset split. It documents the pinned input and verifier revisions, conversion and cleanup stages,
row and archive schemas, loading example, audit files, and the complete generated release report.

## Add a converter

1. Build the `templates` stage. Inspect `coverage.json` and its exemplar under
   `<Marin prefix>/tasktrove/templates/2026.09.10.9/`; the production prefix is
   `s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin`.
2. Add a converter under `converters/` that returns `ConvertedTask` or a specific `Rejected`
   status. Use deterministic parsing; reject rows that need heuristic recovery.
3. Register it in `converters/registry.py`.
4. Add one representative archive under `fixtures/` and a behavior test under `tests/`.
5. Run a Docker audit against source rows:

   ```bash
   uv run python -m experiments.post_training.tasktrove.docker_audit \
     --source <source> --parquet /local/path/to/tasks.parquet \
     --count 20 --out /tmp/tasktrove-audit
   ```

Download the selected source's `tasks.parquet` from the pinned Hugging Face revision or copy that
single file from the `raw` artifact before running the audit. The optional `solution_binary`
contains `solution/solve.sh`; the audit applies it and requires the resulting workspace to score
one. An empty workspace must score zero. SWE solutions that install dependencies require
`--network bridge`.

Rows confirmed broken after release sampling belong in `reviewed_defects.json`, with a reason that
can stand alone in `ledger.parquet`. Use a source-level drop only when the sampled defect is shared
by the source template. Explicit acceptance clauses can be normalized without recovering an
answer; for example, stdin/stdout converters use numeric comparison only when the instruction
states a numeric error tolerance.

## Validate and inspect

```bash
uv run pytest experiments/post_training/tasktrove/tests lib/verifyit/tests
./infra/pre-commit.py --changed-files --fix

# Export one Parquet row as a Harbor task directory.
uv run python -m experiments.post_training.tasktrove.publish export \
  s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin/tasktrove/clean/2026.09.18.2/tasks <task-path> --dest /tmp/tasktrove-task
```

## Route MCQA tasks

`mcqa_routing.py` contains the GLM request, validation, and worker logic.
`mcqa_routing_pipeline.py` owns the recoverable `ArtifactStep` and combines worker outputs.
`apply_mcqa_routing.py` loads the finished mapping and applies it to the clean release.

The routing step assigns mechanically valid MCQA rows to `rl`, `sft`, or `garbage` with GLM-5.3.
Run the pipeline module in a single Iris coordinator and provide
`GLM_BULK_TOKEN` through the job environment. The step launches a replicated CPU worker job. Each
worker reads its assigned Parquet row groups and writes to a separate `worker-NNN` output prefix.

```bash
uv run python -m experiments.post_training.tasktrove.mcqa_routing_pipeline \
  generate \
  --worker-count 64 \
  --request-batch-size 20 \
  --run
```

The step writes to its managed artifact location. On the production prefix, version `2026.09.18.1`
resolves to `s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin/tasktrove/mcqa-routing/2026.09.18.1`. The default routes every
mechanical survivor. Each chat-completion request contains at most `--request-batch-size` questions. A
worker submits all of its requests as one GLM Batch API job. Each completion forces one `submit_routes`
tool call with a strict JSON Schema. The client also checks each returned row ID and model field. Missing
or invalid rows are routed to SFT with an explicit fallback reason; valid rows from the same response are
retained. A failed or expired server-side batch produces SFT fallback mappings for its missing rows.

The step writes `run-config.json` before launching workers. Workers with `summary.json` return immediately;
unfinished workers resume the batch ID in their `batch-state.json`. This permits recovery after coordinator,
worker, or transport failure without reclassifying completed work. Change `ARTIFACT_VERSION` when the input,
rubric, model, or batch settings change.

The artifact root contains combined `decisions.jsonl`, `route-mappings.jsonl`, and `summary.json` files.
Each worker also writes:

| path | contents |
|---|---|
| `decisions.jsonl` | model fields, the raw model route, and the fail-closed final route |
| `route-mappings.jsonl` | compact task-to-route records for downstream selection |
| `summary.json` | counts, provenance, timings, and GLM batch identifiers |
| `requests.jsonl` | submitted Batch API request bodies |
| `raw-output.jsonl` | raw Batch API responses |
| `batch-state.json` | persistent file and batch identifiers used for resume |
| `degraded-requests.json` | request IDs with one or more SFT fallback rows |

The final policy forces material defects, ties, answer mismatches, and key conflicts to `garbage`. An RL
route also requires high confidence, a matching derived choice, chained or multi-constraint reasoning,
prompt-contained evidence, and no defect. All other coherent rows go to SFT.
