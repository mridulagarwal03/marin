"""Small-scale hero-shape ablation: d768 / d1024 / d1280 / d1536 / d2048.

These runs mirror the EP hero: 384 routed experts, top-8 routing, hidden/2-wide experts in a hidden/2
latent, two shared experts, and the pooled-wave all-to-all transport at receiver/sender capacity 1.15.
Each run uses the small sweep width and 750 tokens per active parameter. The runs use the Harrier
2026.08.17.1 mixture.

Each ``--size`` submits one job on the fleet named by ``--target``. The target sets default
expert-axis and cell sizes; ``--expert-axis-size`` overrides the expert axis. See ``TARGETS``.

    The expert overrides let a rung reproduce the hero's routing geometry: cell load is
    ``tokens_per_shard * top-k / experts``, which depends on ``num_experts`` and

    expert-parallel within each rack), which the widest ladder rung needs to hold its batch.
    ``steps_per_eval`` sets both the eval cadence and the permanent-checkpoint cadence, so a
    checkpoint-reload eval job finds a saved state at every eval step.
