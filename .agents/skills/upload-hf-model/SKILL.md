# Upload a model to Hugging Face

- Use the `open-athena` Hugging Face organization when the user has not specified a destination namespace. Honor an explicit destination from the user.
- Upload models under the OpenMDW 1.1 license. Copy the [official license text](https://github.com/OpenMDW/OpenMDW/blob/main/1.1/LICENSE.OpenMDW-1.1) into the model repository's root `LICENSE` file and set `license: openmdw-1.1` in the root `README.md` YAML metadata.
- For every model upload, make sure the model repository's root `README.md` includes this exact text:

  Research artifact. This model has not been properly tested or evaluated and is not necessarily secure. Use at your own risk in production settings.

- Check the published `README.md` and `LICENSE` after uploading or updating the model to confirm that the warning, OpenMDW 1.1 license metadata, and full license text are present.
