# Marin storage tooling

Storage reporting for the `marin-*` GCS buckets and telemetry for CoreWeave
object storage.

## Storage report (on demand)

> **The weekly automation is retired (2026-09).** The `marin-*` buckets are
> scanned daily by [gcs.oa.dev](https://gcs.oa.dev) ([Open-Athena/marin-gcs-usage](https://github.com/Open-Athena/marin-gcs-usage)),
> which posts a running monthly digest thread (weekly bullets in the opening
> post, one reply per scan, owners per prefix) to Discord `#gcs-usage`. Use
> the tooling below for a manual run or a cross-check.

`generate_report.py` is a one-command orchestrator: it opens a tunnel to the
Iris cluster, submits the compute as Iris jobs, then publishes from the laptop
(the same tooling ran from a GitHub Actions runner until 2026-09).

```
scan_fs (Iris) ─> dedup (Zephyr) ─> render_report (DuckDB) ─> gist + Discord
```

```bash
# Full run, publish a public gist (default)
uv run scripts/ops/storage/generate_report.py

# Secret gist plus a Discord summary
uv run scripts/ops/storage/generate_report.py --gist secret --discord internal-discuss

# Reuse prior stages (cheap iteration): skip scan / dedup / report as needed
uv run scripts/ops/storage/generate_report.py --skip-scan --skip-dedup --skip-report
```

Key flags: `--gist {public,secret,none}`, `--discord <channel>`, `--workers N`,
`--history-dir`, `--run-id` (defaults to the UTC date; keeps Iris job names
unique across runs), `--change-threshold-gib`, `--dry-run`.

**Week-over-week diff.** Each run archives a compact per-`(bucket, dir_prefix)`
snapshot (prefixes ≥ 1 GiB, ~1 MiB) to `--history-dir`. The next run flags
prefixes whose size moved ≥ 100 GiB since the prior snapshot, split into
**Increases** (shown first) and **Decreases**. The first run establishes a
baseline. Snapshots are dated UTC; a run never diffs against a same-date
snapshot.

**Modules:** `scan_fs.py` (distributed object scan over GCS, CoreWeave, and R2
via `rigging.filesystem`), `render_report.py` (DuckDB
rollup + diff + markdown), `generate_report.py` (orchestrate + publish).

**Automation.** None. The `ops-storage-report` workflow that ran this weekly
from GitHub Actions was deleted in 2026-09 (see above); run `generate_report.py`
from a laptop with a reachable `marin` controller. Discord posting uses the
channel webhook resolved by `scripts/ops/discord.py` (no bot).

**Prereqs:** `gh` (for `--gist`), `gcloud` + ADC (fetch `report.md`), a
reachable `marin` controller, and the channel webhook for `--discord`.

## CoreWeave storage telemetry

`coreweave_usage.py` reads two CoreWeave metrics and writes their current
values to the Finelog `storage.usage` table:

- `billing:object_storage_used_bytes:total` gives the used bytes for each
  bucket, zone, and storage class.
- `cwobject_quota_info` gives the active quota for each zone and storage class.

Each row has these fields:

```text
provider       coreweave
metric         used_bytes or quota_bytes
zone           CoreWeave availability zone
bucket         bucket name for used_bytes; empty for quota_bytes
storage_class  CoreWeave storage class
value_bytes    raw metric value in bytes
observed_at    time of the CoreWeave metric sample
collected_at   time of the collector run
```

The collector does not calculate storage cost. It keeps the source byte values
so Grafana can compare used storage with the current CoreWeave quota. It fails
if a used zone has no quota series. It does not use a fixed quota value.

Run a local check with a CoreWeave token that has the Observability Viewer
role:

```bash
COREWEAVE_API_TOKEN=... \
  uv run python -m scripts.ops.storage.coreweave_usage --dry-run
```

`.github/workflows/ops-coreweave-storage.yaml` runs the collector hourly at
minute 17. The workflow writes to the `marin` Finelog server through the
standard GCP SSH tunnel. It needs the repository secret
`COREWEAVE_API_TOKEN` and fails without it, because a green run that collects
nothing hides a frozen dashboard. The collector does not run on an Iris
CoreWeave controller or worker, so restarting those services does not restart
collection.

The Grafana `Storage` dashboard shows bucket bytes and quota use for each zone.
The `CoreWeaveStorageQuotaExceeded` rule pages after usage stays above the live
zone quota for five minutes. The critical notification reaches Slack and opens
the Loom ops agent on that alert thread. The rule reads the quota metric, so it
also follows a later quota change.

The `CoreWeaveStorageTelemetryMissing` rule sends one Slack warning when the
newest collector timestamp is more than 24 hours old. It reads `collected_at`,
so the warning reports whether the workflow delivered telemetry without
creating one alert for every bucket and quota series. Check the workflow
history first:

```bash
gh run list --workflow ops-coreweave-storage.yaml --limit 10
```

If GitHub did not create a run during the window, restore collection with
`gh workflow run ops-coreweave-storage.yaml`. If a run failed, inspect it with
`gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`. `collected_at` is when the workflow fetched
a row, while `observed_at` is the CoreWeave metric timestamp. Compare them in
Finelog when the workflow succeeds but the Storage dashboard appears frozen.

For a quota warning, check the zone values in the Storage dashboard and in the
[CoreWeave quota page].

Both rules read the `storage.usage` namespace, which exists only after the
collector writes its first rows. Until then Finelog reports the namespace as
missing, and both rules alert on that non-retryable query error. Run the
collector once when you add a rule that reads a new namespace. A retryable
Finelog service failure returns no data and stays normal; `FinelogFleetUnhealthy`
reports the outage instead.
